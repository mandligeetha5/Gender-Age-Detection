# Objective:
To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture or through webcam.
# About the project
This project is a Python-based implementation of a model that can predict the age and gender of a person from an image or video. The model uses pre-trained deep learning models to detect and classify faces and predict age and gender.
The project contains below mentioned files:
#age_and_gender_Detection.ipynb: This file contains the code for the age and gender detection model. It uses OpenCV for face detection and pre-trained models for age and gender classification. The script can accept both image and video inputs and produces outputs with age and gender predictions.
#people.jpg: This file is a sample input file to test the model on image inputs
#people.mp4: This file is a sample input file to test the model on video inputs
